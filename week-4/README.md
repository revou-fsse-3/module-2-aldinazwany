**C. How to connect your custom domain and DNS**

1. Make sure you already buy external domain. In this example, I already bought domain from niagahoster. Please ensure it is already active.

3. Go to domain management section and click add domain alias. Copy your domain in niagahoster (i.e Aldin.tech) then click verify --> adding domain. Below screenshot is the process after clicking these steps. 

4. To use Netlify DNS, go to your domain registrar and change your domainâ€™s name servers to the following custom hostnames assigned to your DNS zone.

5. On domain's name servers (in this case is Niagahoster), please go to DNS/Namaservers sections and copy all custom hostnames assigned to DNS zone in the Netlify.

6. All process are done. This domain is waiting for external DNS propagation that can take up to 24 hours).

7. Once done, you can go to your custom link by clicking 'site overview' and select your projects and select your domain's link.
